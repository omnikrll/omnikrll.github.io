	<p>I took a lead role in organizing the Babycastles Halloween exhibit for 2018. We settled on the idea of building a themed miniature golf course in the gallery, with different members of the collective creating their own individual golf holes. In brainstorming the concept we decided to forego the standard haunted house tropes of ghosts and witches and the like and instead ruminate on the experience of being haunted by the past. From there we extrapolated a post-apocalyptic storyline.</p>
	<p>200 years after the end of life on Earth, the last remaining specimens of humanity are preserved on sleeper ships drifting in deep space. Cryogenic preservation of the body was a privilege afforded only to the wealthiest, most prominent citizens, while the B-list celebrities were able only to have their minds uploaded into computers. This is how Fred Durst lives on, as a program on a computer on a derelict spaceship. He is dreaming of golf.</p>
	<p><strong>Haunted Golf With A "Z"</strong> featured golf holes by Blake Andrews, Sam Bellamy & Prashast Thapan, Flan Falacci, EL Hohn, Karl Hohn, and Justin Levinson.</p>

	<h3>Black Room (May 2018)</h3>

	</div>
	<p>In May of 2018 I collaborated with artist and game developer <a href="http://www.cassiemcquater.com/" target="_blank">Cassie McQuater</a> to develop a site-specific installation at Babycastles based on her game, <a href="http://cass.itch.io/blackroom" target="_blank">Black Room</a>.</p>
	<p>The game had been included in a number of art shows, but I felt that simply showing it in an arcade cabinet or on a TV screen wouldn't be sufficient to showcase the scope of the game in a gallery setting. It's a work that one needs to sit and play over a long period of time in order to engage with in its entirety.</p>
	<p>Instead, Cassie and I worked together to develop a concept that would move certain parts of the game mechanics from digital interactions to physical ones. There are primarily two kinds of "rooms" represented in Black Room: detailed tableaux screens made up of collaged video game sprites, which one explores by moving a character around the screen; and wireframe perspective screens, which one explores by resizing the browser window to find hidden objects that scroll in or out of view. The tableaux screens work well in arcade cabinets, but we decided to translate the browser-resizing into a physical piece.</p>
	<p>We hung thick black curtains around the gallery to section it off into several smaller spaces. On walking into the gallery, visitors saw a wall decal created by Cassie next to a pile of small CRT monitors showing loops of gameplay footage (thanks to <a href="http://palomakop.tv" target="_blank">Paloma Kop</a> for providing the monitors and setting up the Raspberry Pi's we used for video playback). To the right of the CRTs, curtains hung to partition off the next room of the installation. Another large-scale projection of gameplay footage was shown on the wall, and on the curtains were pinned patches Cassie had printed with the names of the characters used in the game. In the next room, two arcade cabinets were set up with keyboards and mice. The screens showed password prompts, and visitors would enter the names found on the curtains of the previous room to pull up other screens of the game.</p>
	<p>Opposite the cabinets there was a small lounge area with the entire game presented on a flatscreen TV and big pillows to sit on as you played, and next to that was the arcade, featuring a selection of games and net art pieces that informed and complemented the style and aesthetic of Cassie's original game.</p>

	<h2>MAGFest (January 2018)</h2>
	<p>Babycastles was invited back to showcase a selection of games as part of the indie game arcade at MAGFest 2018, held at the Gaylord Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland. I created displays for two of the games.</p>
	<p>For <a href="http://cpprograms.net/gameboy-games/nameless-ld48-game/" target="_blank">Squishy the Turtle</a>, I covered a tent in green fabric to create a giant turtle. Players went inside the tent, where the game was playing on a Super Nintendo.</p>

	<p>For <a href="https://wiki.mfgg.net/index.php?title=Super_Mario_Phone" target="_blank">Super Mario Phone</a>, I made a big version of the phone from the game out of cardboard and affixed it to the front of the game cabinet, so that players were playing a game on the screen of a small phone on the screen of a big phone. <a href="http://shampoo.ooo/" target="_blank">Frank DeMarco</a> dubbed it "the hyperphone".</p>

	<h2>Over The Rainbow (March 16 - April 17, 2017)</h2>
	<div class="img-container"><img src="../src/img/over-the-rainbow-2.JPG"/></div>
	<p>In March of 2016, <a href="http://iasminomarata.com/" target="_blank">Iasmin Omar Ata</a> and I worked with the members of <a href="http://www.artpalestine.org" target="_blank">Art Palestine</a> to organize and curate an exhibition at Babycastles. Over The Rainbow dealt specifically with the 2014 invasion of Gaza by the Israeli army, and showcased work by Palestinian artists reacting to this experience and the recovery from it.</p>
	<p>I worked with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/laraaburamadan/" target="_blank">Lara Aburamadan</a> to create the game <a href="http://omnikrll.itch.io/what-will-you-take" target="_blank">What Will You Take?</a> specifically for this exhibit. Photos and other documentation can be found at <a href="https://babycastles.com/Over-the-Rainbow" target="_blank">Babycastles' website</a> and at <a href="http://www.artpalestine.org/2017/03/over-the-rainbow/" target="_blank">Art Palestine's site.</a>

	<h2>Past Present Future (February 2017)</h2>
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/jonomilo">Jono Mi Lo</a> and I worked together to curate an exhibit of games by black developers for Black History Month 2017. We focused on the work of Jerry Lawson, the inventor of the video game cartridge, and included two games for the Fairchild Channel F console, which he designed.</p>
	<p>For one of those games, "Shooting Gallery", we drew inspiration from a TV show Lawson worked on in the 1970s, called "TV POW". Kids would call in to the show, where a crew member in the studio would be holding the game controller off-camera, hitting the fire button when the kid would say, "pow!" We showed the game on a large projection and invited guests to play it in the same way.</p>

	<h2>MAGFest (January 2017)</h2>
	<p>Babycastles was first invited to participate in the indie game arcade at MAGFest 2017. I worked on displays for two of the games, using paper cones from the water cooler on the arcade floor.</p>
	<p>For <a href="https://palgal.itch.io/alea" target="_blank">ALEA</a> by Paloma Dawkins, we showed the game on a small television inside a tent. We filled the tent with flowers and moss, and I taped some cones over LED puck lights to make them glow.</p>

	<p>For <a href="http://wobblylabs.com/projects/wobbler" target="_blank">Line Wobbler</a> by Robin Baumgarten, I wrote out the letters of the name of the game on cones and arranged them around the LED strip so that it was visible when seen from head-on.</p>

	<h2>Arcade Review x Babycastles (November 2016)</h2>
	<p>This exhibit, organized by <a href="https://twentycapitalletters.com/" target="_blank">Stephen Lawrence Clark</a>, showcased four installation pieces that placed a game alongside a critical essay about the game. Stephen asked me to work on an installation for the game <a href="https://kittyhorrorshow.itch.io/anatomy" target="_blank">ANATOMY</a>. Imitating the core mechanic of the game, I recorded myself reading the essay aloud, split the recording into five sets of two, and dubbed it onto five cassette tapes. These tapes were hidden around the gallery, and visitors were instructed to look for them in order to hear the essay.</p>
