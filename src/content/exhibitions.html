	<p>In March of 2018 I collaborated with artist and game developer <a href="http://www.cassiemcquater.com/" target="_blank">Cassie McQuater</a> to develop a site-specific installation at Babycastles based on her game, <a href="http://cass.itch.io/blackroom" target="_blank">Black Room</a>.</p>
	<p>The game had been included in a number of art shows, but I felt that simply showing it in an arcade cabinet or on a TV screen wouldn't be sufficient to showcase the scope of the game in a gallery setting. It's a work that one needs to sit and play over a long period of time in order to engage with in its entirety.</p>
	<p>Instead, Cassie and I worked together to develop a concept that would move certain parts of the game mechanics from digital interactions to physical ones. There are primarily two kinds of "rooms" represented in Black Room: detailed tableaux screens made up of collaged video game sprites, which one explores by moving a character around the screen; and wireframe perspective screens, which one explores by resizing the browser window to find hidden objects that scroll in or out of view. The tableaux screens work well in arcade cabinets, but we decided to translate the browser-resizing into a physical piece.</p>
	<p>We hung thick black curtains around the gallery to section it off into several smaller spaces. On walking into the gallery, visitors saw a wall decal created by Cassie next to a pile of small CRT monitors showing loops of gameplay footage (thanks to <a href="http://palomakop.tv" target="_blank">Paloma Kop</a> for providing the monitors and setting up the Raspberry Pi's we used for video playback). To the right of the CRTs, curtains hung to partition off the next room of the installation. Another large-scale projection of gameplay footage was shown on the wall, and on the curtains were pinned patches Cassie had printed with the names of the characters used in the game. In the next room, two arcade cabinets were set up with keyboards and mice. The screens showed password prompts, and visitors would enter the names found on the curtains of the previous room to pull up other screens of the game.</p>
	<p>Opposite the cabinets there was a small lounge area with the entire game presented on a flatscreen TV and big pillows to sit on as you played, and next to that was the arcade, featuring a selection of games and net art pieces that informed and complemented the style and aesthetic of Cassie's original game.</p>
