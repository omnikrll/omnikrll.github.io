	<h3><a href="http://bel-air.org" target="_blank">Radio Bel Air</a></h3>
	<p>Community web radio station based in Bushwick, Brooklyn. I do my radio show <a href="http://archive.bel-air.org/tagged/cloud%20circuits" target="_blank">Cloud Circuits</a> here every other Thursday night, as well as helping to organize events and working on our new website (launching soon!!). We have a very eclectic and diverse range of programming, and we broadcast live from the Silent Barn 5 nights a week from Sunday - Thursday.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://silentbarn.org" target="_blank">Silent Barn</a></h3>
	<p>A very cool DIY space for artists and musicians, and the home of Radio Bel Air. Silent Barn houses a venue, artists' studios, a boutique synth shop, a recording studio, a theater company, and more. It's a landmark of Brooklyn's DIY arts scene and one of my favorite places in the city.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://babycastles.com" target="_blank">Babycastles</a></h3>
	<p>Babycastles is another really cool space for the DIY community with a focus on video games, digital art, and music. They have lots of neat events like concerts and game jams. Sometimes I volunteer here.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://magnet.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">MAGNET</a></h3>
	<p>MAGNET (Media and Games Network) is a collaborative space designed to foster cross pollination between the various disciplines of arts and sciences at NYU. I studied here in the Integrated Digital Media program at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, and I come back for things like game jams and conferences.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://redthunderaudio.com/" target="_blank">Ezra Teboul</a></h3>
	<p>Ezra is my bandmate in Passive Tones, and a really brilliant guy. His work with hardware and his research and writing into the history of electronic music is really interesting!</p>
