	<p>Babycastles is another really cool space for the DIY community with a focus on video games, digital art, and music. They have lots of neat events like concerts and game jams. I volunteer here- I've helped install gallery shows, run sound, and work the door for events.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://silentbarn.org" target="_blank">Silent Barn</a></h3>
	<p>A very cool DIY space for artists and musicians, and the home of Radio Bel Air. Silent Barn houses a venue, artists' studios, a boutique synth shop, a recording studio, a theater company, and more. It's a landmark of Brooklyn's DIY arts scene and one of my favorite places in the city.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://p5js.org" target="_blank">p5.js</a></h3>
	<p>p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today's web.</p>
	<p>I've made some contributions to the development of p5.sound, and I am currently contributing to the development of the new p5.js web editor.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://magnet.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">MAGNET</a></h3>
	<p>MAGNET (Media and Games Network) is a collaborative space designed to foster cross pollination between the various disciplines of arts and sciences at NYU. I studied here in the Integrated Digital Media program at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, and I come back for things like game jams and conferences.</p>
