	<h3><a href="http://babycastles.com" target="_blank">Babycastles</a></h3>
	<p>Babycastles is a really cool space for the DIY community in video games, art, and music. They have lots of neat events like concerts and game jams. Sometimes I volunteer here.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://bel-air.org" target="_blank">Radio Bel Air</a></h3>
	<p>Community web radio station based in Bushwick, Brooklyn. I do my radio show <a href="http://archive.bel-air.org/tagged/cloud%20circuits" target="_blank">Cloud Circuits</a> on Bel Air, as well as contributing as a member of the Events and Web working groups. We have a very eclectic and diverse range of programming, broadcasting 5 nights a week from Sunday - Thursday.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://silentbarn.org" target="_blank">Silent Barn</a></h3>
	<p>Another very cool DIY space for artists and musicians, and the home of Radio Bel Air. Silent Barn houses a venue, artists' studios, a recording studio, a theater company, and more. It's a landmark of Brooklyn's DIY arts scene and one of my favorite places in the city.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://magnet.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">MAGNET</a></h3>
	<p>MAGNET (Media and Games Network) is a collaborative space designed to foster cross pollination between the various disciplines of arts and sciences at NYU. I studied here in the Integrated Digital Media program at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, and I come back for things like game jams and conferences.</p>
