	<p>The new website for Radio Bel-Air launched July 18, 2016. We upgraded from a hard-coded static HTML website hosted on an FTP server to a Ruby on Rails app with a proprietary admin back end. The front end is built in AngularJS.</p>

	<p><strong>nullaby (breathe easy)</strong> is a virtual interactive meditation chamber, employing sound, music, and imagery to promote relaxation and mental healing. The intent is to provide an island of tranquility in the increasingly turbulent and chaotic world of cyberspace, as well as exploring the nature of spirituality in the digital age by automating the process of guided meditation.</p>
	<p>Built with <a href="http://p5js.org" target="_blank">p5.js</a> for NewHive's "Relaxation Machine" open call in April of 2016. Source code <a href="http://github.com/omnikrll/relaxation-machine" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

	<p><strong>Going Dark</strong> is a malevolent AI simulator, created for the Ludum Dare 33 "You Are The Monster" game jam in August of 2015. You control the AI of The Wraith, a cruiser on a mission into deep space. Your crew have come out of cryo stasis too early and now pose a threat to the successful completion of your mission: in their inept attempts to regain control of the ship they are inadvertently corrupting your core memory. Thwart their efforts by correctly entering a random string of text in the text box. Succeed and a bit more their life support is cut off; fail and another part of your memory is corrupted and lost, until you are forced into a cold reboot.</p>
	<p>Built with jQuery. Art and writing by <a href="http://github.com/samueldibella" target="_blank">Sam DiBella</a>. Source code <a href="http://github.com/samueldibella/going-dark" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

	<p>An archive of all my Facebook data as of July 4th, 2015, encoded as a Kansas City Standard format 300-baud audio bitstream.</p>
	<p>The Kansas City Standard format was introduced in 1975 as a standard format for storing digital data on audio cassette, at a time when floppy disk drives cost upwards of $1,000. It was used with microcomputers such as the Altair 8800, BBC Micro, and Zenith Z-89, as well as musical instruments such as the Roland TR-707.</p>
	<p>Encoding a 24MB .zip file in this format resulted in a 2.66GB .wav file, which is presented uncompressed to prevent data corruption and is freely available to download and decode (a real-time operation, for which I used a DOS application). While the data is inflated to over 100 times its original size, 21 months' worth of data is compressed to 33 hours and 32 minutes - roughly 0.22% of its original length.</p>
	<p>By encoding a very modern data source in a 40-year-old format, I intend to comment on the volumes of data we produce and consume, and the convenience and speed with which we do so.</p>

	<p>This browser instrument routes the audio of an HTML5 media element through a bank of 13 fixed frequency resonant filters. The architecture of the filter bank is roughly based on that of the <a href="http://www.moogarchives.com/m914.htm" target="_blank">Moog 914 Fixed Filter Bank</a>. Best viewed in Chrome.</p>
