	<p>My submission for <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/i-dont-know-what-to-feel-anymore" target="_blank">Ludum Dare 45</a>. The theme was "Start with nothing," so I made a game that starts on a blank screen, has no scoring system, has no goal, and goes nowhere. There is no progress other than arbitrary forward motion from level to level, each level is totally random, and no level is any more difficult than any other. The only change from level to level is in the generative synthesis: on each click an FM carrier-modulator pair is instantiated, with the frequencies of the carrier and the modulator corresponding to the X and Y coordinates of the mouse click; the ratio of modulation increases with each level, so that the tonal spectrum gets more complex in each level (or, as the ludum </p>

	<p>Witnessing three Israeli wars on Gaza Strip gave us an experience in how to run for our lives when bombs are falling above people’s heads, killing them and destroying their houses, but that doesn’t mean that everyone can have the time to make it. Lara got the idea of this video game project with Karl Hohn, after she had the experience of evacuating her house during 2014, where she was reporting and live streaming with her friend Jehad Saftawi, from the balcony of their apartment on the 11th floor in the center of Gaza City. They packed an emergency bag that has the most important things to take immediately when they leave their house.</p>
	<p>This situation calls to mind the standard feature of inventory management in adventure games. What Will You Take? draws on the style of inventory management from classic PC adventure games such as The Secret of Monkey Island, King’s Quest, or Alone In The Dark. Unlike these, What Will You Take? does not present a full game experience, but instead focuses on examining and interacting with the items packed in an emergency bag. Rather than serving as tools the player uses to advance through a storyline, the objects in the bag instead serve to tell a story themselves.</p>

	<p><strong>Going Dark</strong> is a malevolent AI simulator, created for the Ludum Dare 33 "You Are The Monster" game jam in August of 2015. You control the AI of The Wraith, a cruiser on a mission into deep space. Your crew have come out of cryo stasis too early and now pose a threat to the successful completion of your mission: in their inept attempts to regain control of the ship they are inadvertently corrupting your core memory. Thwart their efforts by correctly entering a random string of text in the text box. Succeed and a bit more their life support is cut off; fail and another part of your memory is corrupted and lost, until you are forced into a cold reboot.</p>

	<p>An archive of all my Facebook data as of July 4th, 2015, encoded as a Kansas City Standard format 300-baud audio bitstream.</p>
	<p>The Kansas City Standard format was introduced in 1975 as a standard format for storing digital data on audio cassette, at a time when floppy disk drives cost upwards of $1,000. It was used with microcomputers such as the Altair 8800, BBC Micro, and Zenith Z-89, as well as musical instruments such as the Roland TR-707.</p>
	<p>Encoding a 24MB .zip file in this format resulted in a 2.66GB .wav file, which is presented uncompressed to prevent data corruption and is freely available to download and decode (a real-time operation, for which I used a DOS application). While the data is inflated to over 100 times its original size, 21 months' worth of data is compressed to 33 hours and 32 minutes - roughly 0.22% of its original length.</p>
	<p>By encoding a very modern data source in a 40-year-old format, I intend to comment on the volumes of data we produce and consume, and the convenience and speed with which we do so.</p>
