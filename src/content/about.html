<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p>WHAT'S UP??? I'm Karl!</p>
<p>I'm a web developer, musician, and an all-around computer nut!</p>
<p>I like stuff like old computers, video games, and cassette tapes.</p>
<p>In my free time I enjoy making music, watching sci-fi and "anime" TV shows (my favorite is STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION), or even just hanging out with friends!! LOL ;)</p>
<p>I also have a radio show called <a href="http://archive.bel-air.org/tagged/cloud%20circuits" target="_blank">Cloud Circuits</a> &mdash; it's a mix of chiptune &amp; video game music with ambient, new age, and experimental electronic music. Tune in every other Thursday at <a href="http://www.bel-air.org" target="_blank">Bel Air Radio</a>!</p>
<p>My favorite foods are Chinese, Mexican, Pizza, and of course ICE CREAM!!! :D :D :D</p>
<p>I live with my cat, Rowley (I'll put up some pictures of her real soon, don't worry!) in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
<p>I hope you've enjoyed learning all about me. Leave a message in my <a href="#guestbook">guest book</a> and let me know what you think of my web site!!</p>
