<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p>WHAT'S UP??? I'm Karl!</p>
<p>I'm a web developer, musician, artist, and an all-around computer nut!</p>
<p>I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Music Synthesis from Berklee College of Music in 2009, and a Masters of Science in Integrated Digital Media from NYU Tandon School of Engineering in 2014. My main areas of focus in school have been electronic music composition and front end development with an emphasis on UI/UX and creative coding.</p>
<p>Since 2016 I've been a member of <a href="http://www.babycastles.com" target="_blank">Babycastles</a>, a nonprofit collective of artists, educators, and game developers working to bridge the gap between the independent game developer community and the greater New York arts community. We operate a gallery space in Chelsea, where we showcase work by artists and game developers from under-represented communities.</p>
<p>I like stuff like old computers, video games, cassette tapes, and floppy disks. I have lots of opinions about games, art, and technology, and <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2017/0920/Empathy-games-tread-thin-line-between-edutainment-and-virtual-voyeurism">sometimes I say those opinions out loud.</a></p>
<p>In my free time I enjoy making music, watching sci-fi and "anime" TV shows (my favorite is STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION), <a href="http://www.dailypublic.com/articles/11182017/interview-todd-rundgren" target="_blank">interviewing rock stars</a>, or even just hanging out with friends!! LOL ;)</p>
<p>My favorite foods are Chinese, Mexican, Pizza, and of course ICE CREAM!!! :D :D :D</p>
